Ideal threshold is around ~750

We receive 2 candidate genes.

The first:
ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecG [Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3-2]

^Salmonella is bacteria. This makes sense.


The second:
needle length control protein [Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2]
antigen presentation protein SpaN [Salmonella enterica]
Invasion protein InvJ [Salmonella enterica]

^These have "salmonella" in the name. Makes sense.
